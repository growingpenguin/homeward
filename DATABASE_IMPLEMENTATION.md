# Database implementation log (Homeward)

How each step of [`DATABASE_PLAN.md`](DATABASE_PLAN.md) was actually built: what was done, the commands run, test results, and anything that changed from the plan and why. Updated after each step, not at the end.

Branching follows git-flow: `main` (releases only) ← `develop` (integration, PRs only) ← `feature/*` (one per step).

## Step 0. Repository

**Date:** 2026-10-20 · **Branch:** `feature/project-setup` → PR into `develop`

- `git init -b main`, then an **empty** first commit on `main` (the usual git-flow start), then `develop` from `main`.
- All files (design docs, deck, schema draft, plans) went in through `feature/project-setup` and a PR into `develop`, so nothing was committed straight to `main` or `develop`.
- `.gitignore` keeps secrets (`.env`) and build output out of git.
- Public GitHub repo: `growingpenguin/homeward`.

**Codex review (`codex review --base develop`):** 2 real findings, both verified:
- P1: `connectFindable` could turn an earlier "no" into a Connect. Fixed in BACKEND.md: it only works on a request that is still pending, checked inside the UPDATE.
- P2: the 100-candidate cut in `find_candidates` ignores age. Added to DATABASE_PLAN.md step 4 (fixed when `find_candidates` moves into `V2__safe_matching.sql`, with a crowded-name test).
- Also found: the review command in CLAUDE.md didn't work (`--base` takes no instructions). Fixed.

**Changed from the plan:** the plan said "first commit on `main` with the docs". To follow git-flow strictly, `main` only got an empty commit; the docs arrive through a feature branch and a PR. `main` will receive them later through a release.
